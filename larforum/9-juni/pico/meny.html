                    Windows Setup Script
                </h3>
                <p>
                    For anyone that might have had problems manually installing the development toolchain under Windows
                    10, then Nikhil Dabas has your back with a new easy-to-use installer to get started on Windows for
                    the C/C++ SDK. The script was inspired by, and is roughly equivalent to, our own pico-setup script
                    for the Raspberry Pi.

                <h3>CircuitPython for RP2040</h3>
                <p>CircuitPython 6.2 brings the examples and libraries of CircuitPython to the RP2040. After installing
                    via UF2, a CIRCUITPY drive appears with code.py. Edit it with your favorite text editor to start
                    coding. The code will re-run after the file is saved.</p>

                <h3>LoRaWAN support for Pico</h3>
                <p>For anyone wanting to connect their Pico to The Things Network via LoRaWAN then Sandeep Mistry has
                    put together support for Semtech SX1276 radio modules. That means that breakouts like Adafruitâ€™s
                    RFM95W board, as well as their LoRa FeatherWing, are fully supported.</p>
