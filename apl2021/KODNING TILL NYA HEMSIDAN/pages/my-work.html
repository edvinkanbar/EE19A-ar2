                    <h1>Previous work</h1>
                    <p>I started my career at the sales floor at H&M. Their business had just bloomed, and they were the label on everyone’s lips. I got an internship where I quickly fell in love with the connection I got from the customers – and the insane amount of feedback I got for my customer service.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But a few comments I received stuck to my mind and heart. Many of them was about me being able to lift the details in every product I managed to sell to them, or the fact that I knew exactly how to market the different items by describing what they would go with, what situation to use it in and where to dress in a particular way. 
                    
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="text2" class="section-text left">
                    <h1>The real deal</h1>
                    <p>That lead me to my first real job ever. <br><br>
                        Originally, I was hired to recruit customers for the customer clubs that the company had in the different shopping malls in Scandinavia, but they quickly learned that my ability to sell and advertise was beyond what they were offering me, so 6 months later I became the youngest employee to ever be responsible for 11 shopping malls. Over 1000 stores and also have the ability to recruit a sales team that was out working the fields I was employed for in the beginning. <br> <br>
                        A big leap? Don’t think so. <br><br>
                        When we felt that my job was done at the startup, and it was time for me to spread my wings wider, I decided to move to jobs where I could combine the skills I’ve learned at Light Agency together with my intense curiosity to learn more.
