                    <h1>Previous work</h1>
                    <p>My passion for writing and marketing has always been strong, but grew even stronger after my internships with WUSA9 TV and TalkNewsRadio stations in Washington D.C. I found a new love and understanding for TV production and the creative ways they worked one by one but as a team. It was inspiring to see the outcome of all the hard work we did and to see our projects, commercials, interviews, stories, articles and shows come alive with the press of a button. 
                        That experience and knowledge led to my very first job as a journalist in Sweden year 2013. 
                        
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Take a look at my journey below and some of the work I’ve done during my years in marketing & journalism:

                    <h1>The real deal</h1>
                    <p>That lead me to my first real job ever. <br><br>
                        Originally, I was hired to recruit customers for the customer clubs that the company had in the different shopping malls in Scandinavia, but they quickly learned that my ability to sell and advertise was beyond what they were offering me, so 6 months later I became the youngest employee to ever be responsible for 11 shopping malls. Over 1000 stores and also have the ability to recruit a sales team that was out working the fields I was employed for in the beginning. <br> <br>
                        A big leap? Don’t think so. <br><br>
                        When we felt that my job was done at the startup, and it was time for me to spread my wings wider, I decided to move to jobs where I could combine the skills I’ve learned at Light Agency together with my intense curiosity to learn more.
